        <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <p>My name is Maxwel Wood, i am 16. For a hobby i play hockey, go to the gym and see my friends. Prior to taking CS A level, i have had experience in doing online python challenges in my free time and also took part in a variety of coding an problem solving base challenges like the "Bebras" chalenge, at which i achived a high score in. I have experience in using tools such as unity to create games and systems, as well as a heavy experience in modding for games such as: Minecraft, Portal and Half-life. I have always been interested in the ways that computers are able to run a set of tasks thousands of times quicker than any human which is able to lead to very fast and precise automation in lots of fields of science. 
        For the future i plan to go into a type of engineering such as mechanical engineering to be able to continue to do research and work with the things that i am interested in.
        For my next future project, i intend to research and devise my own method of being able to do calculations of powers such as ^1/2 with a higher accuracy than what is already been given by python and its math functions. The way that python creates inaccuracies is in the way that you would normally have to round at every step of a calculation, such as to be able to do (5^1/2)*(5^1/2) without any loss of accuracy. If you were to put this into the IDLE now, it would give you the output: 5.00000000000001 which is not exactly 5. I want to solve this.</p>
